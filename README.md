# Lotsa_Fun_Included
 Lotsa_Fun_Included is an ultra light weight Python tool used to search Linux servers for fun files using [Local File Inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_inclusion_vulnerability#Local_file_inclusion) bugs.
 
## Why
Because there's no really good, simple to use, Local File Inclusion testing tools out there.

## How
Python + [Python Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) + A giant word list of interesting Linux files.

## Usage

`python lotsa_fun_included.py`

```
  -ES string
        ElasticSearch URL
  -config string
        Path to an elastic to maltego csv file
  -debug
        debug output
```

## Future Plans
Because we (myself and you the user of this awesome tool) aren't no script kiddies, I'm planning on providing educational knowledge when fun files are found using this script. (What the file is, what you can / might learn from it, etc)
